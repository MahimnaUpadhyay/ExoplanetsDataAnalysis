# ExoplanetsDataAnalysis
Hey There!! I just started to explore the field of **Data Analysis** and let me tell you something I am already in love with it. So here it is my **1st ever Data Analysis project**. In this project, I have used a **dataset of Exoplanets near our Solar System**. I took Dataset from an industry-standard website i.e. **www.kaggle.com**. I did some **data exploration** and **data cleaning** in **MySQL** and exported an improved file in the form of **'.csv'**, After that, I worked with **Jupyter Notebook** and created some **data visualisation** with the help of **Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib etc**. I had a lot of fun while developing graphs. 



# The technology used to develop this project:-
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- MySQL
- Excel



# The examples of Graph I made with the help of Matplotlib and Pandas:- 

1. Scatter Plot Graph **Showing Distance of Exoplanets** which are near our **Solar System**.

3. Pie Chart to show percentage of **Types Of Planets** from dataset.

5. Bar Graph which shows **Detection Method** used to discover **Terrestrial Planets**.
